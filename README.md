# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an expanded version of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. It adds two more choices – Lizard and Spock – to make the game more complex and less prone to ties.

Here's how the five choices interact:

Rock crushes Lizard and crushes Scissors.
Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper.   
Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.   

Essentially, each choice beats two other choices and loses to the remaining two. This creates a circular relationship of dominance.
